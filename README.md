# DEFUSE PROTOCOL

A cooperative bomb-defusal puzzle about talking fast under pressure — **solo VR defuser in the headset**, teammates on the fixed Field Manual.

One player — the **Defuser** — sits in front of a **fully 3D bomb device** on a
table in a dimly lit room: a metal case with protruding module faceplates, real
wires, keycaps, lamps, and an engraved serial plate, viewed through an orbiting
perspective camera. Everyone else — the **Experts** — holds a **fixed Field
Manual** (print it once, or open `manual.html`). The **bomb is random every
game**; the manual rules never change. Nobody has the full picture. Solve every
module before the timer hits zero, and don't collect too many strikes.

The Defuser scene is rendered with Three.js (WebGL): PBR materials with
environment reflections, two physical shadow-casting light sources, SSAO,
depth of field, ACES tone mapping, raycast interaction with every component,
and camera shake + light pulses on strikes. Drag to orbit, scroll to zoom.

**Quest 2 / 3:** immersive WebXR is supported in Meta Quest Browser over HTTPS.
See **[docs/QUEST.md](docs/QUEST.md)** for the full “How to test on Quest 2” guide.
Short version: open the GitHub Pages URL → choose **difficulty** → **START IN VR**.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm start          # http://localhost:3210  (auto-picks next free port if busy)
```

### Play (browser / Quest)

1. Open the app URL (local `npm start` or GitHub Pages).
2. On the **home screen**, pick **difficulty**, optional **seed**, and **video quality** — do this **before** entering VR.
3. **START IN VR (QUEST)** or **START IN AR (PASSTHROUGH)** on the headset, or **START ON SCREEN** on desktop (use **ENTER VR / AR** when ready).
4. Teammates open **[Field Manual](public/manual.html)** on another device (print/PDF once; rules never change).

The Node server under `server/` is optional legacy multiplayer code for local dev; the shipped client is **solo-only** and runs fully from static files.

### GitHub Pages (Quest)

1. Deploy `public/` to GitHub Pages (this repo can do that automatically).
2. On the headset (SOS / classroom): `https://sosgit-app.github.io/defuse-protocol/`
3. Personal copy: `https://SmallerBytes.github.io/defuse-protocol/`
4. Choose difficulty → **START IN VR (QUEST)** or **START IN AR (PASSTHROUGH)** (Quest 3 / 3S)

> `file://` and plain HTTP will not start WebXR.

> The Defuser may not look at the manual, and the Experts may not look at
> the device. Experts: open **[Field Manual](public/manual.html)** (also linked
> in-game) and use **Print → Save as PDF** once — the rules never change.

## Scripts

| Command         | What it does                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm start`     | Run the server (serves the client + WebSocket backend)  |
| `npm run dev`   | Same, with auto-restart on file changes                 |
| `npm test`      | Smoke tests: generation, solvability, seeded determinism |
| `npm run build:solo` | Rebuild the client-side solo game bundle            |
| `node tests/e2e.js <port>` | Full game over real WebSockets (server must be running) |

## The Modules

| Module          | Defuser sees (3D hardware)                                  | Experts have (fixed manual)                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Wire Cutting    | Random colored wires                                        | Fixed rule tables by wire count                     |
| Symbol Matching | 4 random glyphs from one column                             | Fixed 6 symbol columns                              |
| Memory Sequence | Random displays + shuffled labels                           | Fixed per-stage lookup rules                       |
| Morse Code      | Random word flashed in Morse                                | Fixed alphabet + word→frequency table              |
| Joint Functions | Captains × functions × phases (SOS)                        | Example roster (blank function/phase); notes on clipboard |
| Weapons Release | Stores panel: ARM lever, station knob, fuze, code wheels, RELEASE | Weaponeering rules, fuze/code rules, release checklist |
| Radio Net       | UHF radio: coarse/fine tuning, XMIT key, A–Z letter dial   | Fixed comms annex + phonetic authentication matrix |
| Threat Plot     | Radar scope: jet, SAM sites, target — no coverage rings    | SAM coverage table + route rules (talk the jet through) |
| Brevity Code    | CRT word above six brevity-word buttons                    | Two-step indirection tables (word → position → word) |

The **manual is permanent**. Only the bomb layout is random each game (replayable via seed).

## Difficulty

| Difficulty | Modules | Time | Strikes | Timer accel per strike |
| ---------- | ------- | ---- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| Easy       | 3       | 8:00 | 3       | +15%                   |
| Medium     | 4       | 10:00 | 3       | +25%                   |
| Hard       | 5       | 12:00 | 2       | +40%                   |

Easy, Medium, and Hard keep those module mixes. **Hard always includes
Weapons Release**, plus one other hard module. Timer length for each
difficulty can be changed from **SETTINGS** on the home screen (saved in
the browser), including **timer** and **strike limit**. Defaults are
8:00 / 10:00 / 12:00 and 3 / 3 / 2 strikes.

## Design Notes

- **The server is the only authority.** Clients never receive solutions: the
  Defuser gets sanitized module *views*, Experts get *manuals*, and all actions
  are validated server-side. Experts physically cannot trigger device actions.
- **Manual is fixed; bomb is random.** Experts print or bookmark `manual.html`
  once. Device layouts (wires, symbols, stages, Morse word, logic notes) are
  seeded per game for replayability.
- **Session logs** (`logs/*.jsonl`) record every action, strike, and outcome
  with timestamps for post-game review and debugging.
- **3D rendering** uses Three.js loaded from the jsDelivr CDN via an import
  map (pinned to 0.165.0) — playing requires internet access, or vendor the
  files locally and point the import map at them.
- **Video quality**: the Defuser HUD has a LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH selector
  (persisted per browser, default MEDIUM). It controls render resolution,
  shadow casters/resolution, SSAO, and depth of field live — HIGH enables
  everything, LOW disables all shadows and post-processing for weak GPUs.

Inspired by the communication loop of bomb-defusal party games; all puzzle
designs, rules, and content here are original.
